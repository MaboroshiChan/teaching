# Problem 2

Reflexivity:
Let $(x, y, z)\in A$. $(x, y, z)\sim(x,y,z)$ is true because $z = z$.

Symmetricity: Let $(x, y, z), (a,b,c)\in A$ with $(x,y,z)\sim (a,b,c)$. This implies $z =c$. By symmetricity of $=$, we have $c = z$. Therefore $(a,b,c)\sim (x,y,z)$

Transitivity: Let $(x, y, z), (a,b,c), (u,v,w)\in A$ with $(x, y, z)\sim (a,b,c), (a,b,c)\sim (u,v,w)$
This implies $z=c$ and $c=w$, thus $z=w$. Therefore $(x,y,z)\sim (u,v,w)$.

# Problem 3

Refliexivity:
Let $w \in W$, $w \sim w$ is equivalently saying $w$ starts with the same character with $w$, this is obvious true.

Symmetricity:
Let $w, v\in W$, if $w\sim v$, then $w$ can be written as $xc_1c_2\cdots$ where $x$ is a character and $v = xc'_1c'_2\cdots$. Since $x = x$ $v\sim w$.

# Problem 4

b) x= good y = food z = finite 

$x\cap y = \{ood\}$ $y\cap z=\{f\}$ $x\cap z=\{\}$

c) $x\sim y$ =The word $x$ comes before the word $y$, $y\sim x$ = The word $x$ comes before the word $y$ 

Position for each word is unique.

# Problem 4

It is in fact an equivalence relation.

Reflexivity:
$a\sim a$ is true since not everyone is enemy of him/herself.

Symmetricity:
If $a\sim b$, then 


Transitivity: If $x\sim y$ and $y\sim z$ then without loss of generality $x, y\in X$, and $y, z\in X$, then $x, z\in X$ so $x\sim z$
