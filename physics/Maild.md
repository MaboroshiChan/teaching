# **Question of the day**

The same ball is shot straight up a second time from the same gun, but this time the spring is compressed **only half as far** before firing. How far up does the ball go this time? Neglect friction. Assume that the spring is ideal and that the distance by which the spring is compressed is negligible compared to $H$.

## Solution
Assume that in the first time, the spring was compressed $L$ meters. 

The upward net force acted on the ball is

$$F_{\mathrm{net}} = kx - mg$$

We need to find the moment at which the ball left the spring.

This can be done by setting

$$F_{\mathrm{net}} = 0 \iff kx = mg \iff x = \frac{mg}{k}$$

The energy of motion gathered for the ball is 

$$\begin{align*}\int_{L}^{mg/k} F_{\mathrm{net}} dx &= \int_{L}^{mg/k} (kx - mg)dx \\
&= -\frac{(kL-mg)^2}{2k}\end{align*}$$

$$mgh = \frac{(kL-mg)^2}{2k} \implies h = \frac{(kL-mg)^2}{2mgk}$$

$$\frac{(kL-mg)^2}{2mgk} - \frac{mg}{k}$$
