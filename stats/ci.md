Sure! Here is the solution with all the symbols in LaTeX:

To construct a $(1-\alpha)\times 100\%$ confidence interval for the parameter $p$ in the geometric distribution, we can use the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of $p$, which is given by:

$$ \hat{p} = \frac{1}{\overline{x}}, $$

where $\overline{x}$ is the sample mean. The distribution of $\hat{p}$ is approximately normal for large sample sizes, and we can use this fact to construct a confidence interval.

The standard error of $\hat{p}$ is given by:

$$ SE(\hat{p}) = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}, $$

where $n$ is the sample size. We can use this to construct a confidence interval for $p$ as:

$$ \hat{p} \pm z_{\alpha/2}SE(\hat{p}), $$

where $z_{\alpha/2}$ is the $(1 - \alpha/2)$-th quantile of the standard normal distribution.

Substituting the expression for $\hat{p}$ and $SE(\hat{p})$ and simplifying, we get the confidence interval:

$$ \left(\frac{1}{\overline{x}} - z_{\alpha/2}\sqrt{\frac{1 - 1/n}{\overline{x}}},\frac{1}{\overline{x}} + z_{\alpha/2}\sqrt{\frac{1 - 1/n}{\overline{x}}}\right). $$

Therefore, a $(1-\alpha)\times 100\%$ confidence interval for the parameter $p$ in the geometric distribution is given by:

$$ \left(\frac{1}{\overline{x}} - z_{\alpha/2}\sqrt{\frac{1 - 1/n}{\overline{x}}},\frac{1}{\overline{x}} + z_{\alpha/2}\sqrt{\frac{1 - 1/n}{\overline{x}}}\right). $$

In the derivation, we took the logarithm of the joint probability density function (PDF) in order to simplify the expression and make it easier to apply the factorization theorem. The logarithm function is a monotonic function, meaning that it preserves the order of values. Taking the logarithm of a product is equivalent to adding the logarithms of the individual terms, which often simplifies expressions involving products.

In particular, taking the logarithm of the joint PDF of the gamma distribution results in a sum of terms that depend only on individual observations $X_i$, as well as terms that depend only on the parameters $k$ and $\theta$. This allows us to factorize the joint PDF into a product of functions that depend only on the sufficient statistic, $\prod_{i=1}^{n} X_i$, and the parameters $k$ and $\theta$, which makes it clear that $\prod_{i=1}^{n} X_i$ is a sufficient statistic for the gamma distribution.


# Exponential family

An exponential family is a class of probability distributions that can be expressed in a specific mathematical form. Specifically, a family of distributions $f(x|\theta)$ is said to be an exponential family if it can be written in the form:

$$ f(x|\theta) = h(x) \exp\left(\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i(\theta) t_i(x) - A(\theta)\right), $$

where:

$x$ is the observed data;
$\theta$ is the parameter of the distribution;
$h(x)$ is a function that depends only on the data $x$;
$w_i(\theta)$ are known functions of the parameter $\theta$;
$t_i(x)$ are known functions of the data $x$;
$A(\theta)$ is a normalization constant that ensures that $f(x|\theta)$ integrates to 1 with respect to the measure of $x$.
The functions $w_i(\theta)$ are called the natural parameters of the distribution, and $t_i(x)$ are called the sufficient statistics. The normalization constant $A(\theta)$ is also called the log-partition function.

The exponential family is a rich class of distributions that includes many commonly used distributions, such as the normal, exponential, gamma, and Poisson distributions. The exponential family has several useful properties, such as conjugacy, which makes it convenient for Bayesian inference, and sufficiency, which makes it useful for finding minimal sufficient statistics.
