If a group of 9 kids have won a total of 100 trophies, then at least one of the kids has won at least 12 trophies.

## proof:

Assume the contrary, that no kid won at least 12 trophies. `Negate the conclusion, and treat it as a new condition`

Let $K_i$ with $1\le i\le 9$ be the number of trophies the kid $i$ have won.

According to the assumption, $K_i \le 11$. `introduce the contradiction`

$$\sum_{i=1}^{9}  K_i \le 11  \times 9 = 99 < 100.$$

This contradicts to the condition.

## There is no largest odd number

### proof

Assume the contrary, that there is a largest odd number, and let it be $x = 2k + 1$ for some integer $k$.

$x + 2$ is also an integer, and $x + 2 = 2k + 3 = 2(k + 1) + 1$ is also an odd number. But $x + 2 > x$ contradicts to the assumption that $x$ is the largest odd. 

## If [3n + 7 is an odd integer], then (n is an even integer).

The contrapositive proposition is 
```
If (n is NOT even integer ), then [3n +7 is NOT odd integer]
```

which is 
```
If (n is odd integer), then [3n + 7 is even integer]
```
